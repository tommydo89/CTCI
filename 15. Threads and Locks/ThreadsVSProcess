A process is an instant of a program in execution. It is an independent entity that has it's own resources which are not shared between other processes. A thread however is found within a process and it will share the resources of that process with other threads. A thread is a particular execution path of a process and when one thread modifies a process resource, the change is immediately visible to sibling threads
